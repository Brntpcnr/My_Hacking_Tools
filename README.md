Ethical hacking tools I created to perform actions such as mac changing, packet listening, network scanning and arp poisoning.
I use a variety of tools for these operations that can be much more efficient but I wanted to delve deeper into these tools and understand how they work. 
Didn't want to be a script kiddo so here you will see my tools. Enjoy :)

BarMac.py = Mac changer with that comes with parameters:
            
            -h: Shows the parameters
            -s: Displays the current mac address
            -i: Interface that is used
            -r: Assigns a random mac address
            -m: Assigns a new mac address
            
BarNet.py = Net scanner that scans the network and displays the devices. Comes with the parameters:
            
            -h: Shows the parameters
            -r: The IP address range to scan
            -c: Amount of packets to be sent
