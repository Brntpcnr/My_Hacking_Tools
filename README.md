Ethical hacking tools I created to perform actions such as mac changing, packet listening, network scanning and arp poisoning.
I use a variety of tools for these operations that can be much more efficient but I wanted to delve deeper into these tools and understand how they work. 
Didn't want to be a script kiddo so here you will see my tools. Enjoy :)
